"""Tree-routing adaptation operator.

Wraps the existing ``NavigationEngine.navigate`` (agentic branch routing)
and git-branch checkout in the :class:`Adaptation` interface, so the solve
loop no longer needs to know that the storage is a git tree.

This is a faithful extraction — ``select`` delegates to the unchanged
``navigate`` and ``materialize`` ports the per-branch checkout (including
the ``failed_checkouts`` bookkeeping) verbatim from the old solve loop.
Tree routing is now just *one* implementation of the adaptation seam;
other operators (flat skill retrieval, SQL, bash-on-demand) drop in as
sibling classes without touching the harness.
