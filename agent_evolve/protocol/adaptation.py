"""Pluggable solve-time *adaptation*.

Adaptation is the solve-time half of the harness lifecycle: given the
storage the evolver built (a path — today a git repo, tomorrow a SQL
file, vector index, or graph dir) and an incoming task, it projects that
unbounded store into the budget-bounded harness the solver actually runs
with. This is the operational form of the ``L_adapt`` term in the paper:
*organize the space at evolution time, select from it cheaply per task.*

The interface is deliberately tiny and split into two phases so it maps
onto the existing solve loop (route all tasks in parallel, then realize
one workspace per group):

  - ``select``      — per-task, READ-ONLY, parallel-safe. Returns an
                      opaque *selection key* (a grouping label). Tasks
                      sharing a key share one materialized workspace.
  - ``materialize`` — once per key. Mutates the solver workspace in place
                      to realize the harness for that key. All storage-
                      specific logic (git checkout, skill injection, tool
                      install, SQL query) lives here.

Two invariants every implementation must uphold:

  1. **No feedback.** Neither method receives reward/score/success. The
     selector conditions on the task only — never on outcomes. (See the
     evolver-privacy rule: ground truth must not leak into selection.)
  2. **Capacity.** ``materialize`` must leave the workspace within the
     harness capacity budget ``K``.

A concrete operator may put all its work in one method and stub the
other (e.g. a whole-store operator never selects; a pure-prompt operator
never materializes new files).
