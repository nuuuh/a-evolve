## Branch-Aware Evolution

This workspace is version-controlled as a git tree with a main branch
and optional specialized branches. You are currently evolving **main**.
You have full git access via workspace_bash.

### Current Strategy Tree

{chr(10).join(branch_lines)}

### Batch Summary

{batch_summary}

### Exploring Existing Branches

Before deciding whether to create new branches or update existing ones,
explore what each branch contains:

```bash
# See what's different on a branch vs main
git diff main..branch/<name> --stat
git show branch/<name>:prompts/system.md
git show branch/<name>:skills/       # list skills on the branch

# See recent branch evolution history
git log --oneline main..branch/<name>
```

This helps you decide whether an existing branch already handles a pattern
you've identified, or whether it needs updating.

### Branching Instructions

After making your workspace changes on main, analyze the batch results for
evidence of **distribution shift** — patterns where tasks require fundamentally
different techniques that would hurt other tasks if applied globally.

If you identify such patterns, create or update branches directly using git:

1. **Commit your main changes first:**
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "main: <summary of stationary improvements>"
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** or **update an existing one:**

   To create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b branch/<descriptive-regime-name> main
   ```

   To update an existing branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout branch/<existing-branch-name>
   ```

   Use lowercase, hyphenated names describing the strategic shift
   (e.g., `branch/binary-analysis`, `branch/high-uncertainty`).

3. **Evolve the branch workspace** — edit prompts, skills, memory, tools
   to specialize for this regime. Changes here should be tailored — do NOT
   generalize across all task types.

4. **Create or update README.md** at the workspace root describing:
   - **Purpose:** what regime/property this branch handles
   - **Strategy:** the approach and key techniques
   - **Key artifacts:** which files were added or modified and why

   Example:
   ```markdown
   # Branch: branch/high-uncertainty

   ## Purpose
   Markets with price between 0.4-0.6 where evidence is weak.

   ## Strategy
   - Calibration heuristic for uncertain predictions
   - Hedging when evidence is contradictory

   ## Key Artifacts
   - skills/calibration_heuristic/SKILL.md
   - Modified prompts/system.md with uncertainty framing
   ```

5. **Commit the branch changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "branch/<name>: <summary of specialized changes>"
   ```

6. **Return to main** when done:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

Repeat steps 2-6 for each branch you want to create or update.

Guidelines:
- Only create branches for genuine non-stationary shifts, not one-off failures.
- Name branches after the strategic shift, not the topic.
- If all issues are stationary (domain-generalizable), just evolve main — no
  branches needed.
- Always verify branch operations succeeded: `git branch --list`
- Always return to main before finishing.
