"""CL-bench benchmark adapter with rubric-guided skill distillation.

Bridges the CL-bench continual-learning benchmark into the AdaptiveAutoHarness
evolution framework.  Completely self-contained -- does NOT touch any
existing adapter, agent, or engine code.

Capabilities
------------
1. Load CL-bench-grouped.jsonl (+ optional raw CL-bench.jsonl for
   original message-format prompts) and emit Task objects.
2. Rubric-guided evaluation via an LLM judge  -> Feedback.
3. Built-in skill distillation pipeline (distill / mutate / select)
   that can be driven by the evolution loop *or* run standalone.

Quick start (standalone)

    "Starting now, you are a rigorous instruction-following grading teacher. Your task is to accurately grade and score student answers based on the 【Rubrics】.\n\n"
    "Grading Criteria\n"
    "This is a strict, all-or-nothing grading system. The final score is binary.\n"
    "To receive a score of 1, the student's answer must perfectly satisfy every single requirement listed in the 【Rubrics】.\n"
    "If even one requirement is not fully met, the final score will be 0.\n"
    "Grading Process\n"
    "Please strictly follow the steps below for analysis—no steps may be skipped:\n"
    "Step 1: Analyze the Standard Answer\n"
    "List all explicit requirements in the 【Rubrics】 item by item (including format, content, quantity, order, etc.).\n"
    "Identify implicit requirements in the 【Rubrics】 (e.g., language style, logical structure).\n"
    "Define specific evaluation criteria for each requirement (e.g., \"must include X,\" \"must not exceed Y\").\n"
    "Step 2: Check Each Requirement Against the Student's Answer\n"
    "For every requirement in the 【Rubrics】, verify one by one whether the student's answer fully satisfies it.\n"
    "Step 3: Self-Reflection\n"
    "Before giving the final score, you must conduct the following checks:\n"
    "  Completeness Check: Whether all requirements in the standard answer have been reviewed with no omissions.\n"
    "  Strictness Check: Whether the evaluation strictly adheres to the \"fully satisfied\" standard without relaxing requirements due to subjective judgment.\n"
    "  Consistency Check: Whether the grading rationale aligns logically with the final score.\n"
    "  Objectivity Check: Whether judgments are based on objective facts rather than subjective speculation.\n"
    "Output Format Requirements\n"
    "【Grading Rationale】: xxx\n"
    "【List of Requirement Satisfaction Status】: [x₁, x₂, …, xᵢ, …, xₙ] (where n is the total number of requirements in the 【Rubrics】, and xᵢ indicates whether the student's answer meets the i-th requirement, with values \"yes\"/\"no\")\n"

BATCH_DISTILL_SYSTEM = (
    "You are analyzing rubric-graded samples to extract skills about how to "
    "learn from context and satisfy implicit rubric requirements.\n\n"
    "CORE QUESTION: Each task provides a CONTEXT (document, data, scenario) and a "
    "TASK question. The rubrics test whether the response correctly leveraged the "
    "context — including requirements that are IMPLICIT (not stated in the task but "
    "implied by the context's nature, structure, or domain).\n\n"
    "Your TWO goals:\n"
    "1. **Context reading skills**: How should a model read and extract from context?\n"
    "   - What signals in the context predict what the rubrics will test?\n"
    "   - When does the context contain hidden structure (tables, lists, procedures, "
    "taxonomies) that the rubrics expect to be preserved?\n"
    "   - When does the context's domain (legal, scientific, game rules, operational) "
    "imply specific completeness or precision standards?\n\n"
    "2. **Implicit rubric satisfaction**: What patterns cause near-miss failures?\n"
    "   - Samples with \"is_near_miss\": true PASSED most rubrics but FAILED overall. "
    "These are highest priority — small fixes convert them to passes.\n"
    "   - For each near-miss, identify exactly which rubric_details have status=\"no\" "
    "and analyze: was this rubric requirement *visible* from the context alone? "
    "What context signal did the model miss?\n\n"
    "The input includes \"error_analysis_summary\" with top_missed_rubrics (most commonly "
    "failed rubric texts) and categories_by_near_miss. Use these to find systematic gaps.\n\n"
    "OUTPUT: A JSON object with a flat \"skills\" array. Every insight — whether it's a "
    "success pattern, a failure fix, a domain-specific rule, a context reading principle, "
    "or a general best practice — must be expressed as one skill object.\n\n"
    "Each skill object has these fields:\n"
    "- skill_name: short descriptive name\n"
    "- when_to_use: condition that triggers this skill (e.g., \"when context is a technical manual\")\n"
    "- action_rule: what to DO (be specific and actionable)\n"
    "- source: one of \"near_miss_fix\", \"failure_pattern\", \"success_pattern\", "

    "rubrics will test. e.g., \"If context is a technical manual, extract exact section "
    "names before answering — rubrics will test these.\"\n\n"
    "2. **Near-miss fixes** (highest leverage): The error_analysis_summary shows which "
    "rubrics are most commonly failed. Each fix that works converts a 0 to a 1. "
    "Give these skills higher priority.\n\n"
    "3. **Domain-aware reading**: Different context types have different implicit standards. "
    "Create domain-specific skills.\n\n"
    "OUTPUT FORMAT: A flat \"skills\" array. Everything — success patterns, failure fixes, "
